# Student-Database
This is a personal project I worked on in January of 2025 that utilizes SQL databases through an interface made in Java to make a database application that allows users to store and search for information on a university's students and faculty in an organized manner. It's still unfinished, but almost done and I'm planning on finishing it after my 2025 winter semester is done.
